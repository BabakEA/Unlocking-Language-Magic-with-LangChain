Unlocking Language Magic with LangChain

# Welcome to the LLM LangChain YouTube Series Repository!

This repository contains resources and code examples used in the LLM LangChain YouTube series. The series focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs) using LangChain, exploring prompt engineering techniques, and demonstrating how to achieve desired outputs with few-shot learning.

## About the Series

The LLM LangChain series is aimed at providing practical insights into using LLMs effectively, specifically focusing on:

- Understanding LangChain and its role in enhancing connections with LLMs.
- Implementing prompt engineering techniques to fine-tune LLM outputs.
- Demonstrating few-shot learning techniques for obtaining desired outputs without extensive training.

Each episode in the series will cover different aspects of utilizing LLMs and LangChain, providing code examples, demonstrations, and explanations to help viewers understand and apply these concepts in their projects.

## Episodes

- **Episode 1**: Base Prompt Engineering Template with OpenAI
  - Introduction to LangChain and its significance.
  - Creating a base prompt engineering template using OpenAI.
  - Utilizing few-shot learning techniques to achieve desired outputs with minimal training.
